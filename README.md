# uber-insights-dashboard
This project involves end-to-end analysis of Uber ride booking data using SQL and Power BI. It explores patterns in revenue, ride cancellations, and customer ratings.  The analysis is visualized through a Power BI report (uber.pbix) with a custom-designed slide deck (slides.pptx) that serves as a visual canvas background for presentation.
