# Uber-Insights-Dashboard

This project explores Uber ride booking data to uncover insights about operational efficiency, revenue trends, ride cancellations, and customer behavior. It integrates **Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL)** for querying and transformation, and **Power BI** for data visualization. A custom PowerPoint layout is used as a canvas background in Power BI to enhance visual presentation.
